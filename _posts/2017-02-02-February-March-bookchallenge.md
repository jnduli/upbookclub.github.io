## Introduction
A special thanks to the UPBookclub ninjas(and ninjettes) for filling out a form where I had asked for some book recommendations. Well, there are some pretty interesting books people suggested and the list is quite lengthy.  

Here's a couple of recommendations from you guys for the February-March UP Bookshelf. 

## The List 

This [list](https://gist.github.com/BonfaceKilz/014e4708328f44836b6d43d04b353b21) has been arranged randomly  
1. **Flowers for Algernon** by *Daniel Keyes*: Well this book is really short[There is a longer adaptation of this book]. It can be finished in one sitting. This book is a memoir of sorts of a mentally impaired man's journey's search for intelligence. Definitely an interesting one.  
2. **Behind the Beautiful Forevers** by *Katherine Boo*: This is as real with life one can get. Explore life in poverty with Katherine Boo. This book puts life into perspective.  
3. **Crime and Punishment** by *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*: Can be a difficult read, buy its very telling of the human condition.  
4. **The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life** by *Mark Manson*: The title speaks for itself.  
5. **The Tao of Coaching: Boost Your Effectiveness at Work by Inspiring and Developing Those Around You** by *Max Landsberg*: A self-help book. [For some people]Its one of those books that you would not want to part with. Quite inspiration and has helped [some people] in their transition.  
6. **The Beekeeper's Apprentice** by *Laurie R. King*: Long retired, Sherlock Holmes quietly pursues his study of honeybee behavior on the Sussex Downs. He never imagines he would encounter anyone whose intellect matched his own, much less an audacious teenage girl with a penchant for detection. Miss Mary Russell becomes Holmes' pupil and quickly hones her talent for deduction, disguises and danger. But when an elusive villain enters the picture, their partnership is put to a real test.  
7. **An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments** by *Ali Mossawi*: This book briefly introduces logical fallacies to sharpen your critical thinking.  
8. **A Thousand Splendid Suns** by *All Khaled Hosseini*: Born a generation apart and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them—in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul—they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation.  
9. **Eleven Minutes** by *Paulho Coelho*: This book has some very interesting insights into human sexuality.  
10. **Vagina Monologues, The** by *Stephen C. Lawrence(Actor)*: Based on real interviews, this one woman show presents women's views on their bodies and sexuality.  
11. **An Accidental Universe: The world you thought you knew** by *Alan Lightman*: Alan Lightman here explores the emotional and philosophical questions raised by discoveries in science, focusing most intently on the human condition and the needs of humankind. He looks at the difficult dialogue between science and religion; the conflict between our human desire for permanence and the impermanence of nature; the possibility that our universe is simply an accident; the manner in which modern technology has separated us from direct experience of the world; and our resistance to the view that our bodies and minds can be explained by scientific logic and laws. And behind all of these considerations is the suggestion—at once haunting and exhilarating—that what we see and understand of the world is only a tiny piece of the extraordinary, perhaps unfathomable whole.  
12. **Cosmos** by *Carl Sagan*: If you finish this book, you will feel small.  
13. **The Little Prince** by *Antoine de Saint-Exupery*: A very short read. Moral allegory and spiritual autobiography, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the French language. With a timeless charm it tells the story of a little boy who leaves the safety of his own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the vagaries of adult behaviour through a series of extraordinary encounters. His personal odyssey culminates in a voyage to Earth and further adventures.  
14. **The Single Diaries** by *Dora Okeyo*: Whoever said being single at 27 was such a bad idea? Meet Agnes, and her six friends as she opens up about what it means to be single in Nairobi.
